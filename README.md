# qbittorrent gluetun PIA port forward

a simple script for [qbittorrent](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent) meant to be used with [Gluetun](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun).

Getting VPN port forwarding set up when using containers can be a pain since the port number is dynamic. This script automatically updates the incoming port for qbittorrent based on the current forwarded port.

## Usage

1. gluetun should create a file called forwarded_port.
2. that file should be passed to the PIA-port-forward container in a folder called pia.
the container will exit if the environment variables are incorrect or if it cant access qbittorrent's api.

```yaml
services:
  gluetun:
    image: qmcgaw/gluetun
    ...
    environment:
      ...
      - PORT_FORWARDING=on
      - PORT_FORWARDING_STATUS_FILE=/gluetun/forwarded_port
    volumes:
      - ./gluetun:/gluetun
  qbittorrent:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/qbittorrent:latest
    ...
    environment:
      - WEBUI_PORT=8080
    network_mode: service:gluetun
    depends_on:
      - gluetun
  qbittorrent-gluetun-PIA-port-forward:
    image: ghcr.io/robonau/qbittorrent-gluetun-pia-portforward:latest
    environment:
      - QBITTORRENT_URL=http://gluetun:8080
      - QBITTORRENT_USERNAME=username
      - QBITTORRENT_PASSWORD=password
    volumes:
      - ./gluetun:/pia:ro
    depends_on:
      - gluetun
      - qbittorrent
    restart: unless-stopped
```

3. Make sure you're using a VPN region that supports port forwarding.
